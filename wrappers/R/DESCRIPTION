Description: Contains efficient implementations of Discrete Optimal Transport algorithms for the computation of Kantorovich-Wasserstein distances between pairs of large spatial maps (Bassetti, Gualandi, Veneroni (2020), <doi:10.1137/19M1261195>). All the algorithms are based on an ad-hoc implementation of the Network Simplex algorithm. The package has four main helper functions: compareOneToOne() (to compare two spatial maps), compareOneToMany() (to compare a reference map with a list of other maps), compareAll() (to compute a matrix of distances between a list of maps), and focusArea() (to compute the KWD distance within a focus area). In non-convex maps, the helper functions first build the convex-hull of the input bins and pad the weights with zeros.
