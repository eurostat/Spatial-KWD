Description: Contains efficient implementations of Discrete Optimal Transport algorithms for the computation of Kantorovich-Wasserstein distances between pairs of large spatial maps (Bassetti, Gualandi, Veneroni (2020), <doi:10.1137/19M1261195>). All the algorithms are based on an ad-hoc implementation of the Network Simplex algorithm. The package has three main helper functions: compareOneToOne() (to compare two spatial maps), compareOneToMany() (to compare a reference maps with a list of other maps), and compareAll() (to compute a matrix of distances between a list of maps). In case of non-convex maps, the helper functions first build the convex-hull of the input bins and pads the weights with zeros.
