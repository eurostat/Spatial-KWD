## <a name="Description"></a>Computing Kantorovich-Wasserstein distances for large spatial maps

This software library contains efficient implementations of Discrete Optimal Transport algorithms for the computation of Kantorovich-Wassestein distances [1] customized for large spatial maps.

The core library is written in standard ANSI-C++11, but it has two wrappers:

1. A [Python wrapper](https://pypi.org/project/Spatial-KWD/) available from PyPI
2. An [R wrapper](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SpatialKWD) available from CRAN

If you need a wrapper in another language, please let us know by posting a request on GitHub.

Currently, the Spatial-KWD library is tested on

* Google Colabs notebooks
* Windows 10 (R v4.0.5, Python >= 3.6)
* Mac OS X Bug Sur 11.0.1 (R v4.0.5, Python 3.8.3)
* Linux 20.04.1 LTS (R v4.0.0, Python 3.8.5)
* Solaris 10 (R v4.0.5)

## <a name="Requirements"></a>Basic Usage: Colab Notebooks

The simplest way to test this library is to run one of the following notebooks on Colab, which include an example of installation of the library.

## <a name="Python-wrapper"></a>Python Wrapper

The simplest way to install the python wrapper is to run the following command:

```
pip install Spatial-KWD
```

For basic usage of the library, please, look at the Colab notebok.

To compile the [Python](https://www.python.org/) wrapper directly from the source code, you need the following library:

* [Cython](https://cython.org/) (>= 0.23)

To install Cython you can look at the official documentation [Installing Cython](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html).

Then, you have to download this repository, and run from command line the following command:

```
make buildpython
```

This will compile the C++ code and build the python wrapper. If you prefer to compile the wrapper in a local directory, you can run the command:

```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

In this case, however, you can only use the library in the local directory where you compile it.


## <a name="R-wrapper"></a>R Wrapper

The simplest way to install the R wrapper is to run the following command from the R shell:

```
install.packages("SpatialKWD")
```

For basic usage of the library, please, look at the Colab notebok.

To compile the wrapper directly from the source code, you need a recent version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) package (we test it with Rcpp v.1.0.5, but it should work also with older versions).

Windows users can download a pre-compiled binary package at the following link:

* [SpatialKWD_0.4.0.zip](https://github.com/eurostat/Spatial-KWD/releases/download/v0.4.0-alpha/SpatialKWD_0.4.0.zip)


If you need an interface for a different R data structure, please, drop us an email.


## <a name="Cpp-CLI"></a>Cpp Command Line Tool

By compiling the Cpp source code, it is possible to use the **SpatialKWD** directly from the command line.
The compilation is ruled by a simple Makefile, and is executed by the command:

```
make laptop
```

This build an executable named `solver` in the `bin` folder, which can be tested with the following command, which use a synthetic data from the whole Belgium region:

```
./bin/solver data/L_1000_100.csv
```

The output shold be as follows:

```
data/L_1000_100.csv
start solver
